# ❄️ Cold Storage Management System (CSM) ❄️

## Overview

🌟 Welcome to the **Cold Storage Management System (CSM)** — a modern, intuitive web application for managing cold storage warehouses, pallets, products, and IoT sensors.  
🚀 This system empowers organizations to visualize, track, and optimize their cold storage operations with real-time data and interactive 3D interfaces.

> ⚡ **Note:** This frontend requires the [CSM API server](https://github.com/nhttoan0809/CSM-API) to function as its backend.
